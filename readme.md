Please check `reproduce_results.ipynb` to reproduce the results.

* `data.py` has all the functions needed for toy data and real datasets. We consider *penguin*, *iris*, *MNIST* and *MNIST-FASHION* for real datasets.
* `models.py` has simple and tensorized autoencoders.
* `train.py` has the functionalities to train the considered autoencoders.
* `Data` folder is used to store the datasets.

The code is implemented in **python** using **pytorch** library for building and training the models.
